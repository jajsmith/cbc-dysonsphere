This is a CBC podcast. It is my pleasure to introduce this live recording of twenty fifty degrees of change on award winning podcast Host by Johanna Wagstaff, senior meteorologist and science reporter with CBC News. Johanna has hosted to award winning CBC podcasts, fault lines and this one twenty fifty degrees of change, which asks the question. What are we willing to do now in order to change the future? I'd now like to welcome Johann awakes after the stage. I'm here in the forest between Black Rubbish and Fort McMurray. Tornado Still a Threat tonight. In fact, I've never tracked so many tornadoes moving over the same area in Miami Dade County was hit with a hurricane force winds and storm surge last night. Got a rule called the thirty thirty thirty rule temperatures over thirty winds greater than thirty kilometres per hour and relative humidity down below thirty percent. That is a recipe for an explosive fire situation that is the BBC's senior meteorologist, Johanna Wagstaff. Johanna Waxed Op CBC News CBC News Thank you for case. It wasn't clear. I'm Johanna Wagstaff. Hey, for all these years that I've been covering these kinds of extreme weather events, people ask, is this connected to climate change? And the answer is yes. This is twenty fifty degrees of change, a CBC Vancouver podcast exploring how climate change will shape our province and the way we live in the year two thousand fifty. It's the year twenty fifty, and our Eonni is twelve and a half years old. In the original six episodes of this podcast, we heard from some of the leading voices on climate change to find out what life will be like for our Rodney. How will climate change affect everyday life? NBC By the middle of the century, it is eight a. M. On Friday, August fifth twenty fifty. The high today will be thirty two degrees. Environment Canada has extended the heat warning. This is the sixth consecutive day above thirty degrees. Eva, do we have to stay inside again? Today? I was hoping Mom could take me to the beach. Outdoor recreational activities are not recommended at this time. The wildfire in the southeastern part of the province is approaching record size. Almost two million. Hector's of the province is now burning. There's an air quality advisories in effect from metro Vancouver, but I'm tired of staying inside Summer's so boring and I don't have anyone to play with today. Can you find me a new PR holiday? That I haven't already been on life in twenty fifty is very different than it is today, but we didn't just guess what it would be like. Climate scientists used different scenarios based on how humans will act in the future and how much greenhouse gas will be pumping into the atmosphere to predict how our global temperatures will change their several different scenarios. Ones where we change nothing. We could see catastrophic increases in global temperatures by the end of this century. Then there's a so called best case scenario where global temperature rises kept well below two degrees. That's what the Paris accord you've heard about is aiming for. But everything in our podcast, the science, the scenarios is based on a model that falls somewhere between the two. It's a model that involves a lot of change and a lot of hard work, But it imagines that by twenty fifty we've managed to cut global carbon emissions by half and are on track to keeping it stable. So what does this all mean for BC? We asked Trevor Murdoch. He works with the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium out of the University of Victoria, and he says B C will warm up. We're looking at still about two and a half degrees of warming for the province as a whole. When you're averaging over the whole province, there's going to be some important regional differences. So for Vancouver and Victoria, we're looking at about two and a half degrees as well. But there may be larger increases in the interior. On some parts of the North, the variability in some places is more than others. So you know, two and a half degrees of warming on the coast may actually be more like a bigger change relative to historical variability than even a larger change, like three or four degrees somewhere else in the province. And that means wetter, warmer winters and less snow and ice. Ah, low snowpack affects everything from ski slopes to sea levels and fish stocks. Stephan Dearie is a professor of environmental science and engineering at U N. BC. He sees some of these changes already in the Fraser River basin, so the overall precipitation hasn't necessarily change the amount on an annual basis. But what has changed is the phase of that precipitation. We're getting much less snow, perhaps twenty percent less snow and much more rain. And the timing of that precipitation is more towards winter unless during the summers if you have less snow but more rain, you might think that just balances itself out in the water system. But it doesn't work like that. Snow seeps into the water system slowly over months. Well, rain brain can come all at once. Rain, when it falls on the ground, would essentially go straight into the creaks and the rivers and the Fraser River ultimately so drains off very rapidly. And so if the precipitation of Kirsten Winter, then that's going to run off right away and not accumulating the snow pack and build up that water resource that we would normally expect tio have accumulated by the end of spring. In melt out during the summer in twenty fifty, the spring thaw comes fast and early. Flash flooding mudslides. Regular washouts on highways without snow melting gradually. Groundwater isn't replenished through the year, and that means water supply issues for farmers in twenty five. Pity it's impossible to escape. The impact on our food supply and warmer waters also changes salmon migration. Vanessa Mink Marten recently completed her masters at U B C. On the ecology and conservation of Pacific salmon. There's such an incredible, iconic animal and Tio witness that migration is really it's really incredible, but it's like as I'm getting to know them better. I'm also learning about all of the risks and all of the threats to that migration. And it's really scary to think that, you know, they some of those populations might not be around for decades into the future. It's like if we see an increase of only one degree Celsius in average summer temperatures over the next hundred years, that's going to triple the number of days where fish are experiencing temperatures that are above the critical limit. So nineteen degrees. The fact that we've seen so many record breaking high temperature years in the past ten to twenty years, you know this is it's a trend. The trend and climate change is going to reshape our cities as well. Doug Smith is the city of Vancouver's director of sustainability. Change doesn't happen overnight. It's a slow evolution, and Vancouver's been changing dramatically for the last twenty years have compared to where we were in nineteen eighty six. Compared to where we are today. There's a massive change, but it kind of sneaks up on people. It's not overnight, and we're going to see the same thing as we head towards twenty fifty. We're going to see a lot of changes in where we live, how we live, how we travel and the energy we used throughout the whole city. We're talking significant costs. The province did a study with the Fraser Basin counsel a couple of years ago that indicates that if we do nothing to deal with climate change and sea level rise in the region, the basically lower mainland, we would see about a thirty two billion dollars cost to our economy through damage through lost jobs, You name it a whole bunch of things, and to respond to those cost to build dikes and levees and see gates and things is in the neighborhood of about ten billion dollars for the region's. We're talking huge, huge amounts of money that will really have a negative impact on our economy. And we know forest fires in B. C's interior cost us more. Every year, twenty fifty forest fires will be more frequent and more devastating. Here's fire ecologist Bob Gray. We're at a point right now where we have a lot of carbon stored on the landscape and that's the problem, and I'm standing here in the southern interior. We're looking at a force that historically probably had about thirty to fifty stems protector, and right now there's probably close to four thousand. If we want this to survive the next fire, the fire needs to be on the ground. So we have to remove all of this excess biomass. And we have to maintain this in that, you know, low density, tree density grass state through repeated, prescribed burning. And we need to do that over large areas. You know, smoke is a huge issue. We talk about doing a lot more prescribed burning, and people don't want smoke. The issue, though, is How do you want your smoke? There is no no smoke option, so that's a glimpse into our future. And no one's left yet, especially since the president looks very similar. We've already seen some of what experts predicted and far sooner than expected. British Columbia is struggling through one of the busiest, most dangerous wildfire seasons in its history. Hurricane Michael came crashing ashore mid afternoon. J fifty has died kind of extinction looks like the peace. No Chako and Upper Fraser East regions have now been elevated to a drought level. Three. The scientists are clear it's up to the government to decide whether to make the unprecedented policy changes they say are necessary. Canada's minister of the environment and Climate Change insists that it's not possible to move any faster with the change. Clean energy. Here's Catherine McKenna, speaking with the early edition host Stephen Quinn. Tell me how the purchase and expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline helps us meet our climate targets. Well, so when we looked at the trans Mountain expansion, we looked at that in the context of Alberta's climate plan. So Alberta has a hard cap on emissions from the oil sands, so it fits within that. And, you know, I know a lot of people, especially in British Columbia, are wondering Wait a minute. You know, we don't love this project, but the reality is this is a transition over decades. Yes, we want to do it as soon as possible, but you don't shut things down overnight. That's just not realistic. People have such huge but you you slow down, you level off instead. What you're doing is expanding a pipeline so it can carry three times the capacity that it carries now bitch human to be shipped wherever to be to be burned, so we know what we've actually seen that more. Bitch min is going by rail now, so when there's a demand, it's still going to go. And this pipeline has. It fits within the climate plan, and it's like a budget. When you have a plan like Albert has a hard cap on emissions, it has to fit within that plan. We know that we need to move to clean our future. We need to be doing a lot more. We're investing in renewables. We're phasing out cool. We're working with companies across the board to find clean solutions on DH. We need to do that, and we need to work every single day. But at the same time, you need to bring people with you. This is a huge project that creates a lot of jobs and investment, and you can't stop things overnight. Judging by the calls we get in response to our climate coverage on CBC radio, some of our listeners feel resigned to catastrophe. It's getting late in the game. It's possible to get out of this game. I think we've left that legacy for the future of humanity that I have lost state in in the government because we're just being driven by corporations from why are we not realizing this? Get Canada doesn't act now. Then our children in ten years time are going to pursue us. Don't tell me that in thirty years, my kids, they're going to be living in some post apart apocalyptic wasteland and fighting for scraps and water. But we have to think about job. But there are experts out there who believe we can do it. Solutions are out there, and this is what we want to focus on right now. What if we can do something about all of this? What if it's not too late? Do individual actions still make a difference at all? What can each of us do to change for climate change is voting to much ever. Well, if it's not too late to alter the future, what would we need to hear from lawmakers from government? Let's imagine what those future announcements would sound like. The federal budget passed today in parliament, including a five billion dollar investment in carbon sequestering and clean energy world leaders agreed today to implement a global carbon tax of fifty dollars a ton. The binding Yuen Agreement gives countries just two years until twenty twenty eight to implement a new tax. The U. S has shuttered its final coal burning power plant. It was the last nation in the G seven to do so. Today, the Big Five banks announced they will divest from fossil fuels entirely by January. First twenty thirty, Canada announced it will resettle fifty thousand climate refugees this year as part of the OS CDs agreement to help mitigate the human and economic costs of climate change on developing nations. So is this all just some political environmental fantasy? Is it plausible or is it really just too late? The steps needed to change climate change will be controversial and disruptive. Here in our hot audience. We have some people who have been thinking a lot about this. Yes, thank you for coming up to the microphone. Deborah Harford is the executive director of the Adaptation to Climate Change team at Simon Fraser University. Welcome. Thank you, Joanna. Deborah, is it too late? Well, we have already set climate change, emotion and we're feeling it, but it's not too late to stop it escalating. We have a very big task. We have to change the system that's degrading the planet. An escalating risks That means in the twenty first century, all policy planning and decision making, whether political or personal, has to be made through a low carbon resilience lens that's designed to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change. And there's so much we can do about this and there's so much we are doing wherever I look. People are developing solutions from First Nations developing solar power to health authorities, reducing their environmental footprint. Two cities all over BC developing climate plants. But we also know that truly effective climate action must address the resilience of the most vulnerable on DH that it also must take into account that ecosystem health is human health. Other species are being wiped out way too fast. But in the finally, I think the most major priority is to change. The narrative on climate telling stories is what enables us to collaborate with technologies like this podcast. We can connect around the world, and the key now is to shift the story away from shock and horror. We've got to confront the facts, but we've got a shift to an emphasis on benefits and opportunity and show people were acting on. Climate is good for health, security, economy, youth and world peace. So what does give you hope that this shift will happen in time? Well, for me, I'm going to quote Joan Baez. Thie antidote to despair is action. Now I work on climate action every day, collaborating with others identifying golden solutions and working towards them gives me hope. Andi, I see people at every level taking action from use of face networks, indigenous groups, largest more businesses. I'm encouraged by the scale of action a tte the global scale as well. Countries working on the sustainable development goals, the Paris Agreement, China, Britain, India and others. Announcing nails and sales of gas powered cause on the cost of clean energy and energy storage, dropping fast in terms of changing the narrative. One exciting example this year is the Global Commission on Adaptation, which will see Ban Ki moon, Bill Gates and the head of the World Bank seek out benefits and opportunities of building adaptation. But finally my son gives me hope he's twenty five. He's part of a generation that wants change that supports the shift to a green, a way of living. And they know, as we do, that the changes we face are arising from millions of individual actions in terms of what we choose to eat, where drive by and how we vote. So I want to end my comments with a twenty for twenty for twenty four. Call to action toe listeners within twenty four hours of hearing this. Do something to benefit climate change. Then do something in twenty four days and twenty four months later. Do something as well, and your actions will make a difference. Thank you, Deborah. Also with us in the audience is William Cheung. He's an associate professor at U. B C's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries, and he's also lead author on the upcoming IPCC report on Ocean's. Thank you for joining us, Thank you. So what's the most important thing we need to do now to protect our oceans? There are two things that I feel strongly that the oceans are being threatens were now in the are in terms of his ability. Physical is off exploitation of the resources and secondly, is climate change. And there are in the related. We know that global fisheries, many of them are over exploited, and many of them are in calendar the Atlantic, cordis and key example of his cycle of exploitation. But then climate change affecting the ocean's temperature acidity, leading to decrease in auction level in the oceans or affecting fish stocks. It leads to changes in the distribution of fish stocks. We are. We're already seeing fish stocks moving into call the waters in the north and some of the fish that are not doing well because off to warm the water. And this make eliminations of overfishing much more challenging for example, it makes it more difficult to determine what is the good level off fishing or how different countries they're sharing. Similar fish stocks should respond when the fish stocks shift their distribution. But over the years we have gained a lot of experience about how we can tackle, for example, overfishing where we know the Kia drivers, and we know what actions we can take to reduce and eliminate overfishing. And there are already a loss of initiative in Canada and also elsewhere. They're tackling that and have some success story, and we can be on that to actually take over these challenges. We also know that by eliminating overfishing, we can have a lot of capacity for fish stocks as well as for people who are depending on the fish stocks for their life lives such as fishermen, fascination people, Teo adapt to the changing ocean conditions. So I think by eliminating overfishing that's provide a lot. SOF Cho benefits in terms of both a sustainable fisheries. Espo as eliminations off our help, the fish stocks and fisheries to adapt to kind of change and the more portly. I think there are lots of individual actions that we can take to support both more sustainable fisheries as well as doing with climate change issues that would affect the ocean physical way. We can be more careful in picking up what we eat. What way? No, there are lots of initiative, many of them in Canada's that help consumers to know what seafood arm or are from sustainable sources. And so we can be more conscious about our choices off seafood so that we can provide that incentive to support sustainable fisheries and suspend will use ofthe resources. And secondly, I grew up in Hong Kong where I didn't Election is not a strategy is that we often think about in supporting initiatives off government and things like that. But after moved to Canada, I have this privilege and responsibility actually, to make out my choice to support government, that to do things that I think is right to do so. I think that's a really powerful twos for individuals to actually support initiatives. Our government that have initiatives that would promote, in this case a sustainable fisheries, as well as emissions off, helping reduce at the impacts of climate change in the oceans. William, thank you very much. It sounds like you've made the tryst Implement the's individual choices in her life as well. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to introduce our panel now. Joining me on stage is, you may have noticed snuck up. Here are three very special guests. Simon Donner is the associate professor of climatology at the University of British Columbia. Grace knows IQ is getting her phD in law at UBC studying climate justice, and she is a founding member of the student lead UBC climate hub. And, of course, David Suzuki is a Canadian environmentalists, a scientist, an educator and a longtime host of the nature of things and a great dresser just also have to say thank you very much for joining us. And I also want to welcome you, our audience to stand up in front of the microphone throughout the panel. Chat. When you have a question, we want to hear what you are doing in your lives to respond to our changing climate. So please just come up and start forming alive behind line behind the microphone whenever you have a question or a comment. So to get things started, let's pose a question, Teo, our panelists. First of all, Grace, can you share what you've changed in your life to reduce your own carbon footprint? Yeah, for sure. So some of the choices I've made are to go vegan, to cutback immensely on my flights on DH to not buy anything firsthand. But the thing that I'm actually more excited about is just deciding to be a climate ambassador in every part of my life. I thought about where I had the most influence and leverage. And for me that was at the university because I'm a student there with my family and friends and in elections. And so in each area of that, I have kind of put a CZ much time into trying. Teo, Advance climate, justice as possible. So at the university, you know, I found other students who cared as much about climate justice as I did, and we went into every possible stakeholder meeting we could, You know, we and they have to take meetings with us where students right, that's were the ones who have leverage at the university. And we worked our way all the way up. And I think we've really made a huge difference in advancing climate action, which I'll talk more about a little bit later. But then your family and friends, you know, and even strangers I talk about to so many strangers about climate change, because when you talk about building political will on climate change, that sounds kind of sophisticated and fancy. But what it means is that we talk to each other and we say this is the most important norm, making sure that we advance climate justice. I care about it. Will you care about it with me? And so and then elections ins at every level. I'm a voter. I have loved that power of being a voter. And so I go through. I look at my municipal, state or provincial and federal level elections. I block out that week in my calendar, and I know that I'm going to volunteer and getting out the vote for climate justice that I'm going to go back to those family and friends and say You're going to get out the vote with me and just kind of use that influence that we all have. I think that is the thing we can all do. Can you share with us how big the And I know it's it's Ah, brand new. But how big is the climate have now? Yeah, so, I mean, we just held an event. The climate solution showcase the BBC that got at least four hundred people out. But we have way more people wanting to join them. We can even meet that capacity. We just started a climate mentorship program that has one hundred and sixty students who will be meeting twice, twice a month, day and day out building this kind of robust, vibrant climate community on DH. We've done all of this in less than a year. Fantastic. Simon, What do you think the most important thing one person can do to make a difference is well, you know, scientists can actually rank the the impact of different activities that you can fly less. You Khun Dr Lester Driver, more efficient vehicle. You can buy greener energy. You could eat a lower carbon diet, which means eating less red meat. But probably the most impactful thing you can do is to vote right. And it's a four letter word sometimes. But voting is the most important thing you can do. Within that, though, it's really just about being an engaged citizen, you know, and that means writing, calling and stalking within the law. Your representatives. Att. All levels of government. And here's the thing about politicians. They talk about average Canadians all the time, but they don't hear from average Canadians. They hear from people on the two sides. So they hear from activists on issues. And they hear from the people that are opposed to all action on issues. But they probably don't hear from most of the people listening to this. And so we need to do more and more to encourage our government's tele representives. That we care about this issue because governments can't actually solve the problem on their own. But they can set the incentive structure that allows the rest of us to solve it. David, you've been a climate justice champion for decades. What has been the most meaningful change that you've seen in recent years? Well, there's no question the revolution is happening. You know, if you look at the whole area of of wind and solar, and we've really got to thank Germany for jumping in and making a big commitment to getting into renewable, they did that at the time when the cost of solar panels was ten times or more greater. But because Germany made the commitment, they were a big enough market to really drive entrepreneurism and bring down that the cost of solar panels. So the solar panels right now are competitive, and we've got to thank Germany for that. It showed you know that leadership and the impact was on the world. I I must say that the discouraging thing to me when McKenna was put in his the Minister of the Environment when George Haman was minister of the environment, talk to each of them. And I said, Look where your people you know, environmental groups have been working on these issues for decades. So come to us. If you want to know, how do we achieve these deep cuts? Come to environmentalist, For God's sakes, we've been working on these for years. Listening to her now makes me want to puke. She should be. She should be pulled off. She's just mouthing stuff, and I think we've run out of time. We don't have time now, and I think you've both identified the important thing, which is, if we have a democracy, we can now go and demand that the people we elect to serve us serve us and not a corporate agenda. The problem is, environmentalists are kind of regarded as a special interest group. Oh, yeah, yeah, they're the ones that like the environment. You know, those guys over there, they like ballet. Then they're the opera lovers on the car racers. And, you know, we're a special interest groups. And the greens only exacerbate that sense. If you see a debate of all the all party debate and the greens aren't there, journalists act like, Oh, well, the greens aren't here. We don't have to talk about the environment. What the hell agrees? Don't own the environment. I said, Elizabeth May for years. There shouldn't be a green party because the greens should be the foundation of every party. So we've had the challenge now issued by the I P. C. C. And we've got twelve years, according to them, Um, I think it's much more urgent than that. But they said forty five percent off fossil fuels by twenty, thirty and one hundred percent by twenty fifty. So that's the that's the target. And now we've got a much shorter, a shorter time. The next election is October twenty first, twenty nineteen, and as long as climate change continues to be an issue of do we have a carbon tax? How much? What about cap and trade? We're not going to do it. What we've got to do now is to get politicians, every politician running for office at whatever level. The first thing we civil society have got to do is demand. What is your position on climate change? If I vote for you, are you going to make reduction? According to the I P. C C target is that your highest priority? And if not, we're not going to vote for you and we're not going to do it is environmentalists. This has got to be a broad tent. The impact of climate in terms ofthe foreign aid in terms of immigration, with climate refugees in terms of hunger and poverty, the social justice. All of these areas that people are working on are going to be overwhelmingly impacted by climate. So we've got to make a huge tent. No, we've got to get all the doctors in Canada, all the scientists in Canada, we've got to get all the people worried about about poverty in this country, about incoming inequities. All of these people doing good work have got to come together and say climate change is our highest priority. We got to get a party. Doesn't matter what party is elected in the next election. We've got to get all the parties saying climate change is the number one issue and we've got to do that. The minute you get the commitment to reach the I P. C. C target, all kinds of things happen. We cancel the pipeline. Doesn't make any sense. If that's our target, we cancel a forty billion dollars liquefied fracked gas plant. That doesn't make any sense. Today we cancel fracking. We cancel all of the subsidies were giving to the most profitable sector of society the fossil fuel industry. You know, just making the commitment, all kinds of things happen. I know that individuals are prepared to do the best after Fukushima that Japanese voluntarily without any legislation reduced their energy use by twenty percent. And they've maintained that reduction. And there's still a lot more they can do in Japan. I know the Canadians are ready to do it, but we need to have that signal. This is the target, and we've got to get on with it and get the support of the people We elect office. Good. Let me just say I think if we saw the response of kids after the Parkland massacre, those kids drove gun control onto the agenda. And what we've got to do is have children who aren't on the political landscape because he can't vote. Children now have got to be getting up there and demanding that whoever runs for office does something about their future because it's within their lifetime. They're going to feel a heavy impact. So nice to see on that note so many different people of different generations here today, and even up on stage, we're going to have lots of times four questions. First, I just want Teo call on somebody else from the audience. Stephen Shepard is a landscape architect and the director of U B. C's Urban Forestry Program, and you do a lot of work on how climate change will look in our own neighborhoods. So what kind of potential do you see when it comes? Teo Collective or Community Action? Well, I think there's a huge potential for collective action. We call it social mobilization. But the research for sure shows that people, when they work together, can make big changes in greenhouse gas emissions and building community resilience. And so one of the things is that when people see other people talking and working on climate action, they see things in their neighborhoods. They start to join in on DH, so things start to spread. People get benefits like bulk buying of things like solar panels or trees are evey charges and things like that. So when people work together, they have a lot more power. And I think what's happening is that you can see it. For example, with the current natural gas crisis we've got here, NBC with the end bridge explosion up north, we've already got us or twenty percent reduction in green in gas usage right now. That's a social action because someone asked them to do it because this is sort of a need in the temporary on the temperature side. But really, that should be a long term goals. Government have been a little slow. Teo encourage some of these committee led actions, but there's a lot of growing interest in shared collective action on carpooling and cautious things like to sharing commitee food, things like that. And these are things that we are seeing now, and I know that you've seen them now in the community. So that is, That is a hopeful change on the community level. Thank you, Theo. I think we've got time for a question. Before we get back to the panel, can you just introduce yourself and then pose your question or comment? Social engineer. And I think it's great that we're talking about what we can do is individuals and our personal choices to address climate change and also to exercise the privilege that we have his voters. But I think it's also important to talk to young people in particular that there's a lot of opportunities to orient your career towards addressing these issues. I work on climb adaptation related issues every year, doing risk assessment mostly for flooding. And I'm curious of the panelists. Have any additional thoughts on how we can inspire young people, build that capacity and help people toe orient the work that they do to addressing both mitigation and adaptation issues? Well, Grace, this is something I know you're working on right now. Would you like to respond? Yeah, sure. So I love that idea. We are actually actively working on having maybe climate careers fair based around climate change. But also there's right now a climate career commitment that some groups in BC and across Canada are taking on. Where young people can say, You know, whatever I do in the future, it's going to have to do with climate and then they'll be able to use that pledge, maybe to show employers that they're going to have to geared their work towards climate, or or think about it if they want to hire the top top young people coming out. But I think in general were really interested in kind of people in school are really busy and tired, and I think this holds true for all areas. So how do you bring climate to them? How do you really make it easy to feed yourself in? And so that's why we kind of started this climate mender ship model where we've reached every discipline in the entire university. We span the entire range, and we're creating these pods around themes. So are in climate change, or just transitions or biodiversity and climate change or sustainable and snoring. And we're bringing people together graduates and undergraduates so that they can talk every two weeks on DH, come up with projects organically and really brainstorm together what it looks like to combat climate from that lens. And then we think, obviously, as you normalize those conversations and start them, they spread outwards across the campus. But we do have sixty thousand students at UBC who each have their own communities and will be going on into the world. And we think that the climate that we can make many of them, you know, kind of robust climate advocates. Thank you, grace. And see opera and environmentalism can go together. Another question. Hi, I'm Reena. I am a journalism student at Linger, a college, and I've noticed theme among my peers, where many of us are putting the onus of responsibility of climate change on larger corporations and not taking individual action and kind of copping out. I was wondering if the panel had any advice on how to make people care and make people realize that individually our actions do matter well, it's interesting. We've been arguing. Everyone on the panel here's been arguing. How about how important it is to vote right? And why do we vote when there's millions of people in the country in your vote doesn't sound like a loan. It would count, right? But of course, you're contributing to a collective action problem. And I think almost everyone in Cana recognizes that voting is part of, you know, part of the democratic process and that each individual extra vote could make a difference, right? And so the same thing is true of personal actions. So sometimes I have friends. I have family. They will say, Well, why should I do this? Because my neighbors not going to do it was like, Well, you know what, Why do you vote? Why do you do anything that has it as a collective action challenge? And we we practiced this and other sort of lines of parts of life. But not maybe not necessarily when thinking about climate change on, there is also a lot of evidence that we are very heavily influenced by our neighbors. So, for example, if your energy bill says how much energy your neighbor's air using, you may lower lower your energy, your lower your energy use to sort of match them right. And so there's a greater potential in sort of a peer pressure and social mobilization around that so not against climate shaming. Operations are at the heart of it. They are the problem. In nineteen eighty eighth, E Environment had risen to such a name a concern across around the world. In fact nineteen eighty eight, a guy ran for president, the United States and said, You vote for me. I will be an environmental president. His name was George H. W. Bush. He didn't have a green bone in his body, but he but he sent it because Americans had put it at the top of the agenda. Nineteen eighty eight. Margaret Thatcher was film picking up litter in London, and she turned the Cameron said, Well, I'm a greenie, too. Nineteen eighty eight. Brian Mulroney was re elected prime minister to show he cared about the environment. He sha. He appointed his brightest star to be the minister of the environment and brought him into the inner Cabinet. His name was Lucy Ambush. I interviewed Lucien three months after he was put in that position. I said, What is the biggest issue? Facing Canadians? And right away, he said, global warming. I was really impressed. So I said, How serious is it? And these are his exact words. It threatens the survival of our species. We have to act now. So in nineteen eighty eight, the politicians heard it. The climatologist meeting in Toronto, two hundred three hundred scientists met there. And they said the evidence is in human's air causing climate change, and called for a twenty percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in fifteen years. That was it. That was a call. The environment was at the top of the concern. And guess what? The fossil fuel industry they knew their own scientists told them that climate change was happening in humans were the burning fossil fuels were at the heart of it. They then began a campaign led by Exxon to spend tens of millions of dollars every year in a climate in A in a campaign to say it's not settled. This is junk science. This is part of a natural cycle, all kinds of bologna. In order to maintain their profit line. For thirty years, the fossil fuel industry has deliberately deceived the public in a campaign of confusion. And I think if that isn't a definition of evil, I don't know what is. And so let's name it for what it is. It is the corporations because they have only one reason for existence. Doesn't matter whether it's pharmaceutical, whether it's the tobacco industry or or whatever they're on. Ly reason to exist is to make money the mohr and the faster the better. And Exxon shows that in in spades. And the problem we face is that they have convinced the world that they're at the heart of the economy and the economy is our highest priority. So government actually think serving the corporation is what they're supposed to be doing for the benefit of count. We've got to break that chain. So, David, what does give you hope about what's happening right now? Well, that there are these people here quite frankly. Yesterday I was in a Skype connection with Hamilton, where they had an all day conference, all children, and they were high school and elementary school kids running the whole program. They blew me away. They had me in tears because they got it. They know that it's about their future, and they're just getting on with with telling adults they want us to do something about it. So I really think they're at the heart of it. They had they had poets. I couldn't believe the poetry was just amazing. It was just right on and it hit you right in your heart. That's what gives me. The hope is that kids have got it. And now we grown ups have to give them the forum and allow them the chance to really, to really make there, make their statements. And it should be every politician now should should encounter that. That's what civil society is about yet. Add quickly to that answer. There's a really interesting study by Jeffrey Superman and Naomi Are Russkies, and what it shows is. Not only did Exxon undermine belief in science or manufacture doubt around science, they also kind of made people seem like they were less able to tackle it. That was the other thing that they were trying to do, like disempower citizens from making them feel like they could do anything about climate. Andi. I think that's why voting is such an important part because it is this mediation that we can take on at a systemic level. The state regulates corporation. So if we think something needs to change, if we're worried about the actions that they're taking really one of your most powerful levels, levers is voting and getting other people too. Let's see if we can get a couple more questions from the audience. So my name is John or in the next deputy minister for the provincial governments, Environment Ministry. I'm also an adjunct professor at U B C. So the truth prom premises are used in my course. TBC was one that in a sustainable society, economy follows ecology, but education proceeds in both, and the second promise is that self interest has to align with planetary interest. So if you look at the first bond, the order should be education, ecology on economy. The current order. It's the reverse economy. College in education. I tried for ten years to get a course going at UBC. That would be universal. Everybody at U. B C would have a basic literacy in climate science and being a world citizen. But there's a lot of rigidity and bureaucracy UBC and they going interested in developing across campus course. So I'd like to ask you be see friends. What are the chances of creating such a coarse UBC within the next five years so that everybody it's a common understanding of thie ecology and economic linkage and become citizens of the world rather than self interest. Interested citizens, Great question and, yes, Simon's sister jam. Well, so I can't speak for the you know, the curriculum committee of the university. But but actually there is and has been, for a number years, a pushy UBC to have sort of sustainability taut across the curriculum. So there are courses that there there is a course that's offered that actually is neither fact leave art nor factory of science. It's sort of sustainability for the entire campus. But really, the idea was rather, you know, anything, as David Suzuki was mentioning earlier, rather than you know, teach sustainability or climate as its own subject. Rather, it's important embedded in everything. And I'll give an example that's not UBC. But, you know, our federal government did what on the surface looked like a really nice thing when when the Trudeau government came into power, they renamed the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. And it looks great. From the outset, I would say that was a big mistake, actually, because it made climate change yet again, seemed like an environmental issue, right? Where is really what we need? Climate change influences everything, part of government, right? And so and I think the same is true within the university. So if we could organize a course like like gentlemen said, suggesting will be fantastic, I think the bureaucracy UBC is actually harder to solve than climate change. So so the other way to go about it is what we've been doing is trying to in bed climate change sort of Mohr within what's happening in every in every department. And I think we have. There's a lot of amazing examples of that already at at the university. So a great question. Thank you. Another comment from the audience. My name is Alan Shapiro, I'ma Earth science instructor and communicator, and one of my big interests is how do we take this knowledge in this room and in institutions like ABC and share it sort of outside the choir to the people who don't necessarily tune in tow, listen to climate change podcasts and some of the science that's coming out in the research that's coming out in the communication space is showing that these teeth of climate change these droughts and these floods that we've heard about earlier in the podcast are really something that extends past partisanship and unites people and empowers people to do things and local communities. My question is, what can we do to communicate climate change a little bit better outside progressive centers and start looking at what climate change means to people within their communities? Grace, I know again, this is something that you're working on within the climate habit as you mentioned, circles are overlapping. Yeah, so this is definitely something we are thinking about because we think young people do have this space to play. They can go back to their parents and their grand parents and their communities and kind of say, We want you to take action or this matters to us that this is our future. I know some of the social science has said that victims of climate change seemed distance in time and space. So if you can say, actually it's us, it's your children not being able to leave full rich lives. That could be a powerful way to communicate. I guess we're also really interested in having people self actualized through the climate movement. So let's say they want to learn a skill or they're an artist or their poet or these other things. Having the movement just allow you to come in and become a better person or try something. And then, you know, once you made a poem or you've made a song, you want to share that with the people that you love, So you bring it back to a community who might not already be Ah, climate community. But we're going to try and help you make that comic or that graphic novel, and then you're going to share with pride with these other people. And so we really think like hopeful youth storytelling hits a lot of the points from the social science on is also powerful because young people will disproportionately bear the consequences of climate change. I was joke. I my my mom is always asking me about my dating life because she wants grandchildren and I always ask her, I'm like, How's your climate activism going? Because you know, that's when you'll get grandchildren on. And I think that's like, That's a really powerful feeling right that we can all make and young people disproportionately care about climate change. That's what all the data says. So if we do go back to our communities and our families, I think we can break through some of those bubbles we run, we run out of time. We've run out of time. If in the next election, October twenty first next year, if climate isn't the overwhelming issue that all parties are saying Yes, this is if you elect us. This is going to be our highest priority. If if climate doesn't escape being just another political football, then there's absolutely no way that we have a chance of reaching the twenty thirty target. The i P C C says we have to meet. Do you think that you've been working on this messaging for failure? I don't know why I'm no seriously. Do you think that it's fear or that it's hope they know? Okay, I'm trying to get us to cobble together a very broad support. I'm getting in touch with Oxfam M S f Red Cross, doctors of counter the the the Scientists of Canada all coming together and beginning to speak out. The problem is, we are a tribal animal. That's really the level at which we operate. Throughout all of history we dealt with our tribe. That was our our people. We've never had to deal on a level of this magnitude. The on ly time I've ever seen. All people coming together and working together is when we're attacked by aliens from outer space. And they start killing Pete right away. The Russians air calling America. Well, I guess they're already doing that. But the Russians are calling, you know, that's but the this time the alien is us and we've somehow got escape our tribal roots, which Trump is only exacerbating. And and I believe that sheer and these guys, they're doing the same thing. And Harper certainly did it in Canada. We've got to get out of that. It can't be a political issue now. It's got to be too important, and it's got to be for all of us. So my plan is to go to universities this phone and get university students. Some of them are going to start voting by October twenty first, but get them recruited as spokespeople to find young people who will really drive it in the element elementary school, high schools. And then we're gonna have a Siri's in early fall. Next year, we're gonna have a Siri's. Where and we're not going to rent the Orpheum Theater. We're going to rent stadiums where we get ten, fifteen thousand people demanding that climate is the issue, and I guarantee we'll get Neil Young. We'll get Sarah McLachlan. We'll get Serena Ryder will get all these musicians for sure, and Margaret Atwood will come in and this is what we've got to do and it's got to be aimed at October twenty first. And, you know, on a smaller scale, just a reminder that this entire podcast is going to be released packages and released live November twenty sets of this month's of Stephen will hear your pigeon Way will be releasing this on on all of our platforms in just a couple of weeks. I think we have time for another question. First of all, thank you for being here today. My name is Nathan Derek. I'm a freelance writer and editor here in Vancouver. I'm really heartened by all the things that we've talked about that youth could do for myself. I have a three year old daughter. She doesn't really fit into that model of what you can learn in school. Yet she still has a few years to go, but it's something that we're still trying to instill in her right now before she gets into those years. What are things that we can do for kids that are that young so that they grew up with these skills and they've never known life any way different? Yeah, Already done. Yeah, it's a really interesting question. The first time in history you know your daughter is hasn't got a chance leading out a full life. The way we old timers have, that's the reality so she can fight for her future. You've brought her into this world. You've got to be the equal warrior on her behalf. Let her follow her heart as she grows up. Because we need everybody. You know, toe to see the world differently. And you will. You'll raise her so that she sees the world differently. But right now you've got to be a warrior on on her behalf. Every parent with young children ought to be at the forefront. Good luck to you and to all of us. This's this's being such a great discussion. I just want to end it off. And we're one unfortunately have to keep moving on. But Simon, can you just give us your vision of what twenty fifty would look like if we're successful in mitigating climate change? Absolutely. And so one of the mistakes we make in talking about climate change is we don't think about the benefits of action for all these other things. So let's just imagine that we're in a world where we really had solved the major obstacle. You know, the major, your driver of climate change, we'd reduce greenhouse gas emissions to close to nothing. Right? That means we're living in a world war. Our vehicles mostly are powered by electricity. We're mostly powered by electricity and that electricity is being generated. And by clean, clean forms electricity, solar. It's wind. It's hydro etcetera. Right. Think about what Vancouver would be like. Right? Think about what your communities will be like. There'll be no more air pollution. Right? Right. All of this soot all the particulate matter All of the all of the toxic pollutants from cars from power plants, et cetera will be gone, right it'll be a completely different experience to be on a downtown street in Vancouver. First of all, they'll be quiet, right? Because of those vehicles moving around, they won't make a lot of noise. Electric vehicles are quiet, right and there will be clean. The streets will also be cleaner because there won't be certain stuff settling on them. The same stuff that settles in your lungs. It's bad for asthmatics like myself, right? And this is just amazing to me. If we think about this, this is the scourge of the last century. Air pollution killed more people than the world wars combined, right? And we could eliminate it by doing things that would solve climate change. Right? And it's just like this incredible co benefit, and I don't know why we don't talk about this more. Well, let's give a big round of applause to that and to all of our panelists. Sorry, we don't have time for more questions. But there will be, hopefully, some mingling at the end. As the signs of climate change become more apparent, it is easy to feel hopeless. We do all need to remember that big things are happening all over the world in the year and a half since we first produced the twenty fifty podcast. Yes, there have been huge challenges, But check out just a few of the more positive recent headlines. California passed a law requiring the state to get sixty percent of its energy from clean sources. By twenty thirty, Volvo announced. From twenty nineteen onwards, it will on ly produce electric or hybrid cars. The Netherlands re imagined it's coastlines to fortify against catastrophic flooding, and it cost less money than what goes into the U. S. National Insurance Fund for natural disasters. Kenya and Rwanda banned plastic bags. So if we all continue to believe we can do something, maybe we will rewrite our future before we hit that twenty fifty tipping point. Good morning, area knee. It's time to wake up. It is eight A. M. On Monday, December fifth. The temperature is seven degrees Celsius. A mix of sun and cloud is in the forecast. Today is the twenty fifth annual carbon neutral day in British Columbia, a reminder that solar panel maintenance and cleaning are scheduled this morning. Please make sure to close your bedroom windows before leaving for school. Your agenda today includes a meeting with the BBC Climate Hubs. Junior Caucus meeting is scheduled for three thirty. The Skytrain is experiencing no current delays. Thank you, Eva. I'm really looking forward to today's meeting. We're going to be planning a field trip to the verdict of farm again. I want to thank all our panelists. Simon Donner, associate professor of climatology at the University of British Columbia.

Mateusz Wilson, Will Howie, Christian Hammond Seuin Rachel Sanders, Theresa Devil, Cheryl Tobin This bonus episode which really is possibly the best episode. We've never tried anything live before, and I would say this is a huge success. None of this would be possible without all of these people, so thank you. And thank you so much. All of you for joining this episode of twenty fifty on a personal note. I haven't lost hope. And you know you haven't noticed. I will be attempting to welcome a human into the world in the spring. So, you know, I am a climate fighter now more than ever. So I remain hopeful. Thank you. No. Yeah. For more CBC podcasts, go to cbc dot see a slash podcasts.
